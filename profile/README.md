Advanced Wireless and Security Lab (ADWISE)

Founded in 2008 under the leadership of Dr. Kemal Akkaya, ADvanced WIreless and SEcurity (ADWISE) Research Lab conducts research broadly on the networking, security and privacy aspects of Cyber-physical Systems (CPS) and Internet of Things (IoT). Our research exploits theoretical tools from communication, cryptography, game theory, optimization and social sciences while also not ignoring practical tools in terms of simulation, emulation and prototype development.  Over the last decade, our research has been funded by numerous agencies such as National Science Foundation, Department of Energy, Air Force Research Labs, Department of Labor, Cyber Florida as well as industries such as Cisco and TrendMicro.
